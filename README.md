# Challenge Summary

The challenge requires implementing and testing an input which makes a call to a backend. The main tasks are: understand the requirements, frontend development, backend development, tests, and documentation. I'll chunk up work into small PRs and below is the 4 hour plan.

## 4-Hour Timeline

- 1st Hour
  - Make Plan
  - Config repo
  - Chunk up work
- 2nd Hour
  - Bulk of unit tests and features
- 3rd Hour
  - Bulk of end to end testing
  - Edge case refinement
- 4th Hour
  - Refactors
  - Documentation

> [!TIP]
> Commit changes regularly and track progress against the timeline. Worthile building in PRs to help with breaking things up and looking back in future
